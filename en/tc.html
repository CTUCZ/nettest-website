<h2>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>

    <p>
        The web version of the CTU-NetTest can be used only after explicit consent to CTU’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for the CTU-NetTest. The web version of the 
        CTU-NetTest can be used for certified measurements of quality of IAS, due to the nature of web-browser based tools, i.e. measurement of speed values in upload and 
        download directions, up to their advertised speeds below or equal to the limit values of 500 Mb/s (download) and 250 Mb/s (upload). For measuring the advertised 
        speeds above the defined limit values, it is necessary to contact the Czech Telecommunication Office 
        (<a hef="https://www.ctu.eu/e-mailroom" target="_blank">https://www.ctu.eu/e-mailroom</a>).
    </p>

<h3>1 General</h3>
    <p>
        The CTU-NetTest of the Czech Telecommunication Office (hereinafter “CTU”) informs users about the current QoS (including upload, download and ping) of their 
        Internet connection. Additionally,CTU-NetTest offers also the option to repeat test automatically (loop mode). Furthermore, in case a provider provides the IAS on the 
        area of the Czech Republic, the test offers the possibility to carry out a certified measurement. With this, conclusive findings about the quality of the IAS can be made. 
        These findings enable the user to activate remedies available in compliance with national legislation in case of any significant and continuous or regularly recurring 
        discrepancy of actual service performance regarding its upload and download speed, from the performance the IAS provider stated in the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        CTU’s legal authorisation to offer the CTU-NetTest, including the possible processing of personal data within the CTU-NetTest, is enshrined in 
        <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2120" target="_blank">Article 4 (4) and Article 5 (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 </a> 
        (hereinafter “EU Regulation”). To fulfill this duty and ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and information – while respecting their privacy – the 
        CTU-NetTest is based on the open data and open source principles.
    </p>

        </p>

    <h4>2.2 Certified measurement option</h4>
        <p>
            In addition to the data listed under 2.1, the certified measurement processes the data that users enter in the online form for the certified measurement:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>first name and last name including title,</li>
                <li>address at which the certified measurement is carried out,</li>
                <li>photos uploaded by the user,</li>
                <li>information on the environment of the measurement (for example, the Internet connection).</li>
            </ul>

<h3>3 Processing and the purposes of personal data </h3>
    <h4>3.1 CTU-NetTest and loop mode option</h4>
        <p>
            As a part of the CTU-NetTest and its loop mode option, the following personal data are processed: the Client UUID and the IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Purposes for processing these personal data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>client UUID: possibility of compiling a test result history for the user; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions; 
                    exercising of the user´s rights according to item 5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IP address: Technical enabling of the CTU-NetTest and ensuring the full functionality, in particular display of the map and quality measurements; 
                    in order to be able to assign the tests to individual service providers (via routing information – autonomous system number or host names); detection of improper use or malfunctions.
                </li>                
            </ul>            
        </p>
            
    <h4>3.2 Certified measurement option</h4>
        <p>
            Within the certified measurement, the personal data mentioned in 3.1 are processed. In addition, the personal data entered by the user in the online form 
            (first name and surname including title, address at which the certified measurement is carried out, ISP and IAS details and photos) are processed. These are used to create the PDF 
            document of the certified measurement.
            After validation, the address of the measurement is processed for statistical overview and evaluation of measurement results at the address point level. 
            Valid measurement results at a given address point can be displayed within the Visualization Portal of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<a href="https://vportal.ctu.gov.cz">https://vportal.ctu.gov.cz</a>).
        </p>
            
<h3>4 Duration of storage</h3>
    <p>
        The IP address is stored by CTU for a maximum period of six months. In any case, the Client UUID will be deleted with the final termination of the CTU-NetTest (delete functional cookies - RMBTuuid).
    </p>
    <p>
        The personal data which the user provides in the online form (first and last name including title, address at which the certified measurement is carried out and photos) 
        are stored for a maximum of 48 hours. The address of the measurement is stored in the database of the CTU-NetTest tool, in case of successful validation it is also stored in the database
        of the CTU Visualization Portal and can be displayed on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data gathered during the measurements carried out so far remain a part of records even after the withdrawal of consent. So, the user´s personal data are not the part 
        of these data.
    </p>
            
<h3>5 Rights in connection with personal data</h3>
    <p>
        By providing the randomly generated client ID (Client UUID) - which can be found under the Options bookmark - the user has amongst others the following rights 
        concerning her or his personal data:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>access to personal data,</li>
