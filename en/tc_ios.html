<h2>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for iOS</h2>

<p>
    The mobile application of CTU-NetTest can be used only after explicit consent to CTU’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for the CTU-NetTest. 
</p>

<h3>1 General</h3>

<p>
    The CTU-NetTest mobile application of the Czech Telecommunication Office (hereinafter “CTU”) informs users about the current QoS (including upload, download and ping) 
    of their Internet connection. CTU-NetTest provides also further possibilities to users with wider technical interests: CTU-NetTest offers also the option to repeat test 
    automatically (loop mode). Furthermore, it is possible to use the loop mode only for signal for which it is possible to repeatedly measure only signal parameters, 
    without measuring the speed and QoS.
</p>
<p>
    CTU’s legal authorisation to offer the CTU-NetTest, including the possible processing of personal data within the CTU-NetTest, is enshrined in 
    <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2120" target="_blank">Article 4 (4) and Article 5 (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 </a> 
    (hereinafter “EU Regulation”). To fulfill this duty and ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and information – while respecting their 
    privacy – the CTU-NetTest is based on the open data and open source principles.
</p>

<h3>2 Which data are processed?</h3>

    <h4>2.1 CTU-NetTest and selection of loop mode and certified measurement</h4>
        <p>The following data are processed as part of the CTU-NetTest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>actually achieved speed of data connection in both directions (download/upload)*,</li>
            <li>roundtrip delay of data connection (ping)*,</li>
            <li>test parameters (test method, test status, test server, test configuration)*,</li>
            <li>randomly generated client ID (Client UUID),</li>
            <li>evidence of acceptance of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use,</li>
            <li>public client ID*,</li>
            <li>client sync code and group,</li>
            <li>randomly generated ID of the measurement series (Loop UUID),</li>
            <li>test start time,</li>
            <li>automatically determined client location (if known) / time zone*,</li>
            <li>exact client location (determined by the optional manually entered address of the measurement),</li>
            <li>anonymised (dissected) location (determined by the optional manually entered address of the measurement)*,</li>
            <li>meta information for the client location (e.g. location accuracy, method of determining the location, distance)*,</li>
            <li>device type/model, operating system/software version of browser*,</li>
            <li>NAT Yes/No (direct Internet access or private address used)*,</li>
            <li>IP version*,</li>
            <li>IP address,</li>
            <li>AS name and number (autonomous system) or anonymised IP address*,</li>
            <li>WLAN network ID (SSID) and numeric WLAN ID (BSSID),</li>
            <li>Wireless network, e.g., home network, mobile network, connection type (GSM, UMTS, LTE, 5G etc.), mobile network name, frequency used, base station‘s 
                identification*.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The data marked with asterisk * are published on the CTU-NetTest website and are publicly available as 
        <a href="/en/Opendata" target="_blank">open data</a> for information, use, dissemination and repetitive use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: After providing consent with „Privacy Policy and Terms of Use“, to authorise the use on devices with more SIM cards, a message „Allow CTU-NetTest to initiate 
        and manage calls“ (dependently on the device’s operation system). Thus, the identification of a SIM card currently used for mobile data is allowed within the context 
        of CTU-NetTest use. The CTU-NetTest does not use any other functions authorised this way.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2 Loop mode</h4>
        <p>
            The loop mode allows to automatically carry out repeated measurement with the CTU-NetTest tool by personalised user setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first test is started after switching on the loop mode. Next tests are started after the waiting time (the default time is 15 minutes) passes or after passing 
            the given distance (the default distance is 250 metres). Tests will be running until a requested number of tests is reached (the default number of tests is 10). 
            The level of signal is measured continuously, even in between of two tests.
        </p>
    
    <h4>2.3 Loop mode only for signal</h4>
        <p>
            The loop mode only for signal allows to automatically carry out repeated measurement of signal parameters also without measuring the speed or QoS. 
            The user can stop the loop mode anytime or it is automatically switched off after 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data processed is the same as listed in point 2.1 with exception of roundtrip delay (ping), signal level, testing communication on selected network ports, 
            content modification, reference website transmission test, background data traffic, server DNS requirement, traceroute, VoIP test; Therefore, no personal data are 
            processed.
        </p>

<h3>3 Processing and the purposes of personal data</h3>

    <h4>3.1 Processing and the purposes of personal data</h4>
        <p>
            As a part of the CTU-NetTest and its loop mode and loop mode only for signal, the following personal data categories are processed: (1) the Client UUID, 
            (2) WLAN network ID (SSID) and numeric WLAN ID (BSSID), and (3) the IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Purposes for processing these personal data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>client UUID: possibility of compiling a test result history for the user; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions; exercising of 
                    the user´s rights according to item 5. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    WLAN network ID (SSID) and numerical WLAN ID (BSSID): presentation in the user’s history; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    IP address: Technical enabling of the CTU-NetTest and ensuring the full functionality, in particular display of the map and quality measurements; 
                    in order to be able to assign the tests to individual service providers (via routing information – autonomous system number or host names); detection of improper use or malfunctions..
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

<h3>4 Duration of storage</h3>
    <p>

<h2>CTU-NetTest – Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>
       Users use the browser version and app of the CTU-NetTest on their own risk. Please, send any comments on correction of inaccurate content, graphics, etc. 
       per e-mail to <a href="mailto:nettest@ctu.cz">nettest@ctu.cz</a>.

    <p>
       The CTU-NetTest of the Czech Telecommunication Office (hereinafter “CTU”) informs users about the current QoS (including upload, download and ping) of their Internet 
       connection. Additionally, CTU-NetTest offers also the option to repeat test automatically (loop mode). Furthermore, in case a provider provides the IAS on the area of 
       the Czech Republic, the test offers the possibility to carry out a certified measurement. With this, conclusive findings about the quality of the IAS can be made. 
       These findings enable the user to activate remedies available in compliance with national legislation in case of any significant and continuous or regularly 
       recurring discrepancy of actual service performance in terms of upload and download speed, from the performance the IAS provider stated in the contract.
