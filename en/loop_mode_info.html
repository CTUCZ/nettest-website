            <p>The loop mode allows to automatically carry out repeated measurement with the CTU-NetTest tool by personalised user setting.</p>
            <p>The first test is started after switching on the loop mode. Next tests are started after the waiting time (the default time is 15 minutes) passes. 
                These values can be set in “Settings”. Tests will be running until a requested number of tests is reached (the default number of tests is 6). 
                In case of long-time loop mode setting is this mode automatically switched off after two days. The user can stop the loop mode anytime.</p>
