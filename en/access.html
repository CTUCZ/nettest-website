<h3>Information presented in non-standard formats</h3>
    <p>
        The website also refers to information in the form of PDF and XLSX documents. In the case of the PDF format, these are mainly the Guide to Certified Measurement, 
        which contains detailed instructions, including explanations of related concepts and procedures. Reference is also made to legally binding documents on the main 
        website of the Czech Telecommunication Office (<a href="https://www.ctu.gov.cz" target="_blank">https://www.ctu.gov.cz</a>) or to decrees on the official notice board. 
        All documents are electronically signed and there is currently no other alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
        A document containing the results of the certified measurements is also available in PDF format. This format has been chosen in view of the use of this document as 
        a basis for exercising the right to complain or object to the handling of complaints about electronic communications services. This means primarily for printing or the 
        possibility to electronically sign the file in the case of electronic submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PDF and XLSX formats are used to export results and export open data due to the scale and size of the results. Alternatively, selected results can be exported 
        also to CSV format or can be viewed and filtered directly on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        To view these documents, you can download free versions of open source office applications and PDF readers. Most web browsers can also open PDF documents.
