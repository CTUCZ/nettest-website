<h2>Guide to certified measurement in Android mobile application</h2>

<h3>1 Purpose of the certified measurement by CTU-NetTest tool:</h3>

<p>The measurement can be used by the end-users to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Determine the coverage level (covered/not covered) at a particular location according to the conditions defined in a decision on granting of rights to use radio 
        frequencies for the provision of electronic communications networks, issued by CTU. If the result of the certified measurement is in contradiction with the coverage 
        map (published by the operator at its website), the user can submit a claim to the operator and support it by the protocol which is the certified measurement 
        outcome;
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the download/upload speed and to compare it with the speed stated in the contract on the service provision. If the result of the certified measurement is 
        in contradiction with the contract, the user can submit a claim to the operator and support it by the protocol which is the certified measurement outcome.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>2 Conditions for carrying out the certified measurement</h3>

<ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
    <li>
        <strong>Outdoors in open spaces (outside buildings, cars etc.).</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Without movement during the whole measurement (60 minutes).</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>At the hight of about 1,5 m (values of the signal levels have been defined for such hight).</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>All data-consuming apps switched off (those which require data connection).</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Connected solely via mobile data network (LTE, 5G) and Wi-Fi switched off.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>GPS turned on (location identification function).</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sufficient amount of data available (the measurement will consume about 1 GB – depending on speed).</strong>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>3 Interpretation of the certified measurement results</h3>

<p>
    The summary of the measurement results can be found in the protocol in chapter “Carried-out measurements”. It contains summary of the results gained in individual 
    measurements. These are a basis to decide whether the location is covered or not covered by mobile network signal and whether the download/upload values are compliant to 
    those stated in the contract between user and operator.
</p>
<p>
    Should any error occur during the measurement, it will be stated in the chapter “Validation“. In such case, it is necessary to repeat the measurement.
</p>
<p>
    The last chapter of the protocol is “Results of individual measurements“. It includes detailed technical information for operators who will deal with potential 
    claims regarding the coverage.
</p>

<h3>4 Detailed description of the certified measurement</h3>

<p>
    Conditions for carrying out the certified measurement in Android mobile application are based merely on the following documents:
</p>
<ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">

        <a href="https://www.ctu.gov.cz/sites/default/files/obsah/stranky/vyhlaseni-vyberoveho-rizeni-2013/soubory/vyhlasenivyberovehorizeni15082013priloha3.pdf" target="_blank">
            Annex 3 of the Invitation to tender for granting of the rights to use radio frequencies to provide electronic communications networks in the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz 
            and 2600 MHz frequency bands (Czech only).
        </a> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.ctu.gov.cz/sites/default/files/obsah/ctu/oznameni-ceskeho-telekomunikacniho-uradu-o-vyhlaseni-vyberoveho-rizeni-za-ucelem-udeleni-prav-k/obrazky/20200811-annex5.pdf" target="_blank">
            Annex 5 of the Invitation to tender for granting of the rights to use radio frequencies to provide electronic communications networks in the 700 MHz and 3400–3600 MHz.
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.ctu.gov.cz/sites/default/files/obsah/ctu-new/WEB_EN/vo-s-10820209en_1.pdf" target="_blank">
            Another important parameter for evaluating the service performance, in case of mobile Internet service, is the contractually defined value of normally available 
            speed or minimum guaranteed speed. It is decisive to determine whether there are discrepancies, if any.
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>The certified measurement is a cycle composed of 6 time-diversified tests within 1 hour.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Each of the 6 tests takes approximately 1 minute and time spacing between individual tests is 10 minutes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Each test is composed of initialization, measurement of remote server response/round-trip delay (ping) and data transmission test having duration of 10 seconds for 
        each direction of data communication (download and upload).
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Certified measurement regime may cause high data consumption. When combined with high-speed Internet access service, 6 tests may consume 1 GB or more. We highly 
        recommend using the regime of repeated measurements only with tariffs without FUP limit where you do not risk additional financial costs by exceeding your 
        FUP limit.  
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    First important parameter for evaluating the quality of service is the coverage level of the operator´s mobile network signal. Minimum signal level for availability 
    of the services (“covered”) is defined by “Annex 5 of the Invitation to tender for granting of the rights to use radio frequencies to provide electronic communications 
    networks in the 700 MHz and 3400–3600 MHz” and “Annex 3 of the Invitation to tender for granting of the rights to use radio frequencies to provide electronic 
    communications networks in the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2600 MHz frequency bands”.
</p>
<p>
    These documents contain the following table, used also for this certified measurement, which includes limit values for inspection measurements of the outdoor coverage, 
    and which shows what signal level is decisive for determination of whether a location is covered or not covered by mobile network signal:

        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2600 MHz</td>
            <td>– 105</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3440–3800 MHz</td>
            <td>– 100</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>
    If an operator states in its coverage map that the location is covered, it must reach these minimum levels. CZ coverage maps of the particular operators:

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Second important parameter for evaluating the service performance is, in case of mobile Internet service, the contractually defined value of normally available speed 
    or the minimum guaranteed speed. It is decisive to determine whether there are discrepancies, if any.
</p>
<p>
    If the actually achieved download or upload speed decreases below the contractual minimum speed for the respective direction of data communication, the service is 
    having an outage, i.e., it is not being provided. In such case, you can submit a claim against the provision of service.
