        <p> In case of very high number of user requests to carry out tests, the loop mode may be refused to protect the measurement server from getting overloaded. 
            Please, note that the loop mode is designated (only) for areas within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
        <p> The loop mode can cause high data consumption, based on your requested setting. 
            When combined with fast IAS, the 10 tests carried out can consume 1 GB and more. 
            Therefore, we strongly recommend using the loop mode only with FUP-less tariffs where using up the FUP will not bring you additional costs.</p>
