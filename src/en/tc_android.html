<h2>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>

<p>The web version of the CTU-NetTest can be used only after explicit consent to CTU’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for the CTU-NetTest. The web version of the CTU-NetTest can be used for certified measurements of quality of IAS, due to the nature of web-browser based tools, i.e. measurement of speed values in upload and download directions, up to their advertised speeds below or equal to the limit values of 500 Mb/s (download) and 250 Mb/s (upload). For measuring the advertised speeds above the defined limit values, it is necessary to contact the Czech Telecommunication Office (<a hef="https://www.ctu.eu/e-mailroom" target="_blank">https://www.ctu.eu/e-mailroom</a>).</p>
<h3>1 General</h3>
<p>The CTU-NetTest of the Czech Telecommunication Office (hereinafter “CTU”) informs users about the current QoS (including upload, download and ping) of their Internet connection. Additionally, CTU-NetTest offers also the option to repeat test automatically (loop mode). Furthermore, in case a provider provides the IAS on the area of the Czech Republic, the test offers the possibility to carry out a certified measurement. With this, conclusive findings about the quality of the IAS can be made. These findings enable the user to activate remedies available in compliance with national legislation in case of any significant and continuous or regularly recurring discrepancy of actual service performance regarding its upload and download speed, from the performance the IAS provider stated in the contract.</p>
<p>CTU’s legal authorisation to offer the CTU-NetTest, including the possible processing of personal data within the CTU-NetTest, is enshrined in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2120" target="_blank">Article 4 (4) and Article 5 (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 </a> (hereinafter “EU Regulation”). To fulfil this duty and ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and information – while respecting their privacy – the CTU-NetTest is based on the open data and open source principles.</p>
<h3>2 Which data are processed?</h3>

    <li>IP network (autonomous system, AS) or anonymised IP address*</li>
</ul>
            <p>The data marked with asterisk * are published on the CTU-NetTest website and are publicly available as 
                <a href="/en/Opendata" target="_blank">open data</a> for information, use, dissemination and repetitive use.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Certified measurement option</h3>
            <p>In addition to the data listed under 2.1, the certified measurement processes the data that users enter in the online form for the certified measurement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>first name and last name including title</li>
                <li>address at which the certified measurement is carried out</li>
                <li>photos uploaded by the user</li>
                <li>information on the environment of the measurement (for example, the Internet connection).</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>3 Processing and the purposes of personal data </h2>
            <h3>3.1 CTU-NetTest and loop mode option</h3>
            <p>As a part of the CTU-NetTest and its loop mode option, the following personal data are processed: the Client UUID, the optional manually entered address of the measurement, and  the IP address.</p>
            <p>Purposes for processing these personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>client UUID: possibility of compiling a test result history for the user; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions; 
                    exercising of the user´s rights according to item 5.
                </li>
                <li>optional manually entered address of the measurement: 
                    If the location cannot be determined automatically more precisely than to 2 km, the user has the option to enter the address of the measurement manually. 
                    This data, marked with * (= exact location determined by the optional manually entered address of the measurement), is converted into coordinates and is visible 
                    as a measurement point on the CTU-NetTest map only for the user who carried out the respective test. The entered address of the measurement is not kept saved. 
                    Third parties see merely the measurement point on the map, which is based on anonymised (dissected) coordinates. Only the dissected coordinates of the optional 
                    manually entered address are published as open data under <a href="/en/Opendata" target="_blank">https://nettest.cz/en/Opendata</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>IP address: Technical enabling of the CTU-NetTest and ensuring the full functionality, in particular display of the map and quality measurements; in order to be able to 
                assign the tests to individual service providers (via routing information [AS] or host names); detection of improper use or malfunctions.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Certified measurement option</h3>
            <p>Within the certified measurement, the personal data mentioned in 3.1 are processed. In addition, the personal data entered by the user in the online form 
                (first name and surname including title, address at which the certified measurement is carried out, and photos) are processed. 
                These are used to create the PDF document of the certified measurement.</p>
            <h2>4 Duration of storage</h2>
            <p>The IP address is stored by CTU for a maximum period of six months. In any case, the Client UUID will be deleted with the final termination of the CTU-NetTest.</p>
            <p>The personal data which the user provides in the online form (first and last name including title, address at which the certified measurement is carried out, 
                and photos) are stored for a maximum of 48 hours.</p>
            <p>Data gathered during the measurements carried out so far remain a part of records even after the withdrawal of consent. So, the user´s personal data are not the part of these data.</p>
            <h2>5 Rights in connection with personal data</h2>
            <p>By providing the randomly generated client ID (Client UUID) - which can be found under the Options bookmark - the user has amongst others the following rights concerning her or his personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>access to personal data,</li>

            <p> CTU’s legal authorisation to offer the CTU-NetTest, including the possible processing of personal data within the CTU-NetTest, is enshrined in 
                <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2120" target="_blank">Article 4 (4) and Article 5 (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 </a> 
                (hereinafter “EU Regulation”). To fulfil this duty and ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and information – while respecting their privacy - the CTU-NetTest is 
                based on the open data and open source principles. In case there is a change in the processing or handling the data gathered through the CTU-NetTest, especially with 
                regard to the new versions of the CTU-NetTest, the user shall explicitly give a consent to these conditions again. In order to enable the CTU-NetTest to function properly and 
                to do what you expect, some of the operating and technical data that are obtained during its use or provided in connection with its use, are processed.
