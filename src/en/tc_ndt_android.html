<p>
    The NDT-Test of the research platform M-Lab is an optional, but more comprehensive test for
    interested users, which measures additional technical parameters. Please note that this test
    increases the time duration of the measurement and the transmitted data volume considerably.
    As part of the more comprehensive test, data – such as IP-addresses – are transferred, which
    means that these data are permanently stored and published by M-Lab and are made freely accessible
    to the general public for information, use, dissemination and other applications under M-Lab-Open
    Data to the M-Lab research platform and made publicly available online, including outside of the EU.
    Given the processing and transfer of IP-addresses to non-EU countries, it is possible that a
    user’s identity may be determined or become determinable and that personal identification is possible.
