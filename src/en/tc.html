<body style="color:white; font-size:80%; background-color:#104967;">

<p>

    In order to ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and
    information,
    the RTR-NetTest app can be used only after explicit consent to RTR's Privacy
    Policy and
    Terms of Use for the RTR-NetTest.
</p>

<h1>1. Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>1.1 General</h2>

<p>In compliance with the statutory provisions at national and European level, in particular the Austrian Data Protection Act 2000 (DSG 2000) as last amended and the Austrian Telecommunications Act 2003 (TKG 2003) as last amended, RTR offers users the opportunity to use the RTR-NetTest. Under 14 years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of their legal guardian.</p>

<p>RTR&rsquo;s legal authorisation to offer the RTR-NetTest is enshrined in <a href="https://www.rtr.at/en/tk/TKG2003">Art. &nbsp;17 Par.&nbsp;4 and Par.&nbsp;5 TKG&nbsp;2003</a>. According to Art. &nbsp;17 Par.&nbsp;4 TKG&nbsp;2003 the regulatory authority is entitled <i>&bdquo;&hellip;&nbsp;to undertake, or have undertaken, independent reviews of the performance benchmarks to be able to check the accuracy and comparability of the information provided. The regulatory authority may publish the information provided as well as the results of the performance benchmark reviews.&rdquo;</i> In addition, the regulatory authority is entitled under Art. 17 Par. 5 TKG 2003 <i>&ldquo;&hellip;&nbsp;to offer instruments and review mechanisms which enable subscribers to review the information pursuant to Article 25 Par. 4 Nos. 2, 3 and 4.&ldquo;</i></p>

<p>To fulfil this duty and ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and information &ndash; while respecting their privacy &ndash; the RTR-NetTest is based on the open source and open data principle. According to the open source principle, this means that the source code of the RTR-NetTest software is publicly accessible and that RTR has put the components it has developed under an open source licence (see Terms of Use).
    The RTR-NetTest logo and the RTR-NetTest font are not subject to the open source and open data principle and copying, modifying or processing them in changed or unchanged form is prohibited. The RTR-NetTest data listed under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a> are retrievable as open data and are under the usage of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/at/deed.en">Creative Commons Namensnennung 3.0 &Ouml;sterreich (CC BY 3.0 AT) License</a> so made freely available to the general public for information, use, dissemination and other applications. Data which are not retrievable under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a> are not subjet to the open data principle.</p>

<p>As regards the privacy policy, the following is pointed out (for further details see items 1.2 and 1.3 below):</p>

<ul>
    <li>The RTR-NetTest can only be performed after explicit acceptance by the user of the privacy policy and the terms of use. This acceptance can be withdrawn at any time. The acceptance is logged for evidential purposes.</li>
    <li>When changes are made to the processing and transmission of data (in connection with updates or new releases of the RTR-NetTest), users will have to renew their acceptance.</li>
    <li>The RTR-NetTest comprises two separate test sets that can be used completely independently:
        <ul>
            <li><b>The first</b> is a test developed by RTR (= RTR Multithreaded Broadband Test, hereafter the RMB-Test), which measures ping, download, upload and further quality parameters;</li>
            <li><strong>The second</strong> is an optional, more comprehensive test (= Network Diagnostic Tool test) of the M-Lab research platform, hereafter NDT-Test), which includes other technical parameters.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Users have the option at any time to run the RMB-Test only or the NDT-Test as well.</li>
    <li>The browser version of the RTR-NetTest uses cookies. Cookies are little files sent from the server hosting the website to your computer&#39;s hard disk when you visit the RTR-NetTest website. These cookies store the following sets of data: acceptance of the privacy policy and terms of use; the randomly generated client ID (client UUID); the location/post code (temporarily); NDT-Test yes/no information. These data are used to identify users the next time they visit the RTR-NetTest website.</li>
    <li>Notification of the Austrian Data Protection Authority under Art. 17 DSG 2000 has been effected.</li>
    <li>Questions about the privacy policy relating to the RTR-NetTest can be send to
        <a href="mailto:netztest@rtr.at">netztest@rtr.at</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 RMB-Test</h2>

<h3><i>1.2.1 What data are processed and transmitted?</i></h3>

<p>The following data are <b>processed</b> as part of the RMB-Test:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Speed of data connection in both directions (downlink/uplink)<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Latency of data connection (ping)<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Quality parameters (e.g. signal strength, connectivity on different ports, modifications of content, transfer time for a reference web page)<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Test parameters (test method, test progress, test server, test configuration (e.g. test duration))<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Randomly generated client ID (client UUID)</li>
    <li>Public client ID<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Client sync code and group</li>
    <li>Test time<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Automatically determined client location (where known) / time zone<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Exact client location (determined out of the optional manually entered address of the measurement)<b style="color:red">&Dagger;</b></li>
    <li>Anonymised (dissected) location (determined out of the optional manually entered address of the measurement)<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Client location (where known) / time zone<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>Device type/model, operating system/software version of app or browser<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>NAT Yes/No (direct Internet access or private address used)<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>IP version<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>IP network (autonomous system, AS) or anonymised IP address<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
    <li>WLAN network ID (SSID) and numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</li>
    <li>Mobile network (home network, network used, type of connection (GSM, UMTS, LTE, etc.), name of mobile network<b style="color:red">*</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The data marked with an asterisk <b style="color:red">* </b>and&nbsp;<b style="color:red">&Dagger;</b> are transmitted.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This means that the data marked&nbsp;<b style="color:red">*</b> are published on the RTR-NetTest website and the RTR-NetTest app and are made freely available to the general public as open data under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a> for information, use, dissemination and other applications. Data not marked with <b style="color:red">*</b> are not transmitted, i.e. these data are
        neither disclosed nor published and are not retrievable as open data under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a> (see also item 1.2.2).</li>
    <li>If the location cannot be determined automatically to better than 2km, the user has the option to enter the address of the measurement manually. This with
        <b style="color:red">&Dagger;</b>  marked date (= exact location, determined out of the optional manually entered address of the measurement) is converted into coordinates (processed) and published as a measurement point on the RTR-NetTest map (transmitted). The entered address of the measurement is not stored. In case the measurement address is optionally provided merely anonymised (dissected) coordinates are available as open data under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data not marked with <b style="color:red">* </b>or <b style="color:red">&Dagger;</b> are not transmitted, i.e. these data are
    neither disclosed nor published and are not retrievable as open data under
    <a
            href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a> (see item 1.2.2).</p>

<h3><i>1.2.2 Information relating to personal data</i></h3>

<p>In the course of the RMB-Test the IP address and the Client UUID are processed. The IP address and the Client UUID are not transmitted, i.e. they are neither disclosed nor published and are not retrievable as open data under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a>. The IP address is stored for a maximum period of six months. In any case the Client UUID will be deleted with the final termination of the RTR-NetTest.<br />
    If the location cannot be determined automatically to better than 2km, the user has the option to enter the address of the measurement manually. This date is converted into coordinates (processed) and published as a measurement point on the RTR-NetTest map (transmitted). The entered address of the measurement is not stored. In case the measurement address is optionally provided merely anonymised (dissected) coordinates are available as open data under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a>.</p>

<p>This is necessary</p>

<ul>
    <li>regarding the IP address: in order to be able to assign the tests to individual operators (via routing information (AS) or host names), to identify improper use and compile a history of use for the users;</li>
    <li>regarding the Client UUID: possibility for the user to withdraw the acceptance to processing the IP address; possibility of compiling a history of use for the user; identifiying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions.</li>
    <li>Regarding the optional manually entered address of the measurement: Due to the often technically limited ability to determine location in browsers, a measurement with the RTR-NetTest can often not be displayed on the map (if the location cannot be determined more accurately than 2km). So that users are able to see their measurement on the RTR-NetTest map, they shall have the possibility to enter optional manually the address of their measurement.</li>
</ul>

<div class="tc_border">
    <p><b>When running the RMB-Test, users explicitly accept the processing of their IP address and Client UU</b><strong>ID, the processing and transmission of the exact client location, which is determined out of the optional manually entered address of the measurement, as measurement point on the RTR-NetTest map, and the pr</strong><b>ocessing and transmission of other data, as described above in 1.2.1., by clicking the &ldquo;<i>Agree</i>&ldquo; button.</b></p>

    <p><b>Users may withdraw their acceptance to processing of their IP address and Client</b><strong> UUID and the processing and transmission of the exact client location, which is determined out of the optional manually entered address of the measurement, as measurement point on the RTR-NetTest map at </strong><b>any time. </b>Acceptance can be withdrawn by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:netztest@rtr.at">netztest@rtr.at</a> and referring to the randomly generated client ID (= Client UUID) or by sending a letter to Rundfunk und Telekom Regulierungs-GmbH (RTR-GmbH), c/o RTR-NetTest, Mariahilfer Stra&szlig;e 77-79, 1060 Vienna, Austria. The client UUID can be found in the browser under <i>Options</i>.</p>

    <p>Notification of the Austrian Data Protection Authority of commencing a data application under Art. 17 DSG 2000  has been effected.</p>
</div>

<h2>1.3 NDT-Test</h2>

<h3><i>1.3.1 What data are processed and transmitted?</i></h3>

<p>The following data are <b>processed</b> and <b>transmitted</b> as part of the NDT-Test:</p>

<ul>
    <li>speed of data connection in both directions (downlink/uplink);</li>
    <li>TCP/IP protocol parameters (e.g. TCP receive window);</li>
    <li>proportion of IP packet losses, connection errors (e.g. half duplex);</li>
    <li>latency/jitter of data connection (ping);</li>
    <li>test parameters (test method, test server, test configuration);</li>
    <li>operating system (name/version) and processor architecture;</li>
    <li>Java runtime environment (name/version);</li>
    <li>IP version;</li>
    <li>IP address (local/public);</li>
    <li>host name of computer;</li>
    <li>NAT and firewall status and data connection parameters;</li>
    <li>test time;</li>
    <li>test data transmitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data <b>processed</b> during the NDT-Test are <b>transmitted</b> to the M-Lab research platform (<a href="http://www.measurementlab.net/">www.measurementlab.net</a>). This means that these data are published by M-Lab and made freely accessible to the general public for information, use, dissemination and other applications. A list of data processed and transmitted during the NDT-Test can be found at <a href="https://www.netztest.at/redirect/en/mlabdoc">https://www.netztest.at/redirect/en/mlabdoc</a>. The results of the NDT-Test are also processed by the RTR-NetTest website and the RTR-NetTest app and are &ndash; with the exception of the IP address &ndash; transmitted, i.e. they are published on the RTR-NetTest website and the RTR-NetTest app and are retrievable as open data under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a>.</p>

<h3><i>1.3.2 Information relating to personal data and data traffic with non-EU countries</i></h3>

<p>During the NDT-Test the IP address is processed and transmitted to the M-Lab research platform outside the EU; this means that these data are permanently stored and published by M-Lab and are made freely accessible to the general public for information, use, dissemination and other applications under M-Lab-Open Data. This is necessary in order to be able to assign the tests to individual countries and operators. The data protection requirements in countries that are not members of the EU may be less strict than in the EU. Because the IP address is processed and transmitted outside the EU, this may mean that the identity of the user of the RTR-NetTest can be identified or is potentially identifiable, which could result in being able to establish the user&rsquo;s personal identity within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 DSG 2000.</p>

<p>The IP address is not transmitted on the RTR-NetTest website and in the RTR-NetTest app, i.e. the IP-address is not published and under <a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a> as open data retrievable. It is stored by RTR for a maximum period of six months.</p>

<div class="tc_border">
    <p><b>The NDT-Test is only run if, after accepting the privacy policy and terms of use of the RTR-NetTest, the checkbox &ldquo;<i>I wish to run the optional, more comprehensive NDT-Test</i>&ldquo; is selected. The user explicitly accepts that for the NDT-Test the IP address and other data are processed and transmitted outside the EU as explained above in item 1.3.1.</b></p>

    <p><b>Users may withdraw their acceptance of the NDT-Test, and therefore to processing and transmission of their data outside the EU, at any time.</b> Acceptance can be withdrawn by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:netztest@rtr.at">netztest@rtr.at</a> and referring to the randomly generated client ID (= Client UUID) or by sending a letter to Rundfunk und Telekom Regulierungs-GmbH (RTR-GmbH), c/o RTR-NetTest, Mariahilfer Stra&szlig;e 77-79, 1060 Vienna, Austria. The client UUID can be found in the browser under <i>Options</i>. In addition, users can deactivate running of the NDT-Test on their own at any time. Thereafter only the RMB-Test will be run.</p>
